            </p>
            <p>You can simply register yourself here and start contributing to any participating open source project from Oct 01 - Oct 31. And if you meet the contribution criteria set by DigitalOcean, you’ll receive a Hacktoberfest t-shirt from DigitalOcean!

            <h2 class="blog">Why Contribute to LoginRadius Open Source Projects?</h2>

            <p>LoginRadius is an industry-leading Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) provider with a mission to secure every identity on this planet.

              At LoginRadius, we’re committed to making our cloud platform more accessible for developers across tech stacks, so they can quickly implement user registration and authentication processes in their applications and become more efficient at focusing on core business features.

              We’ve always loved open source and the many great things it has done for the software development community and businesses. This inspired us to open source many of our projects, including SDKs, LR CLI, and Async Blog, a leading publication for developers by developers.

              Through our open source projects, we actively collaborate with the developer community and drive change and innovation for the optimistic progress of everyone.

              When you contribute to our open source projects, you’re helping the whole developer community become efficient, productive, and helping them manage user identities and authentication on their applications securely and scalably.</p>
